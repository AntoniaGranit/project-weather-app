# Weather App

The task was to program a weather app that displays the temperature, weather description, sunrise/sunset times, and a five-day forecast of a specific city. We also had to design it in accordance to one of two designs that were provided by the bootcamp. We first started by emulating Technigo's design and adding all the elements in HTML, that we then inserted the information from the provided API to. We wanted to add some additional features and decided on geolocation and icons


## The problem

Our biggest challenge was working in branches and then merging those branches to the master branch, specifically when merging into the javascript file. We had some issues solving the conflicts that resulted from the merge, and had to do it manually to retain all the functions the way we wanted. We also had some initial issues with the function for the different weather-based deis
